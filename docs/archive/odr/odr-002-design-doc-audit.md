## Context

Seven core design documents (VISION, SPEC, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, TEST, CACHE, PHASE3-PLAN) had accumulated inconsistencies after multiple rounds of development. The Strategy interface signature differed across three documents and the actual Go code. Services described as "current specs" did not exist in the codebase.

## Decision

Establish a four-dimension audit framework and apply it to all core documents:

1. **Structural completeness** — TOC, section logic, redundancy check
2. **Conceptual accuracy** — type signatures match code, cross-document consistency
3. **Technical feasibility** — architecture diagrams correct, data flow valid
4. **Format compliance** — Markdown syntax, code block annotations, link validity

Applied fixes:
- C-01: Unified Strategy interface across VISION/SPEC/ARCHITECTURE/strategy.go (4-way consistency)
- C-02: Marked risk-service and execution-service as "⚠️ Planned" in SPEC.md
- H-01~H-05: Fixed date inconsistencies, outdated ROADMAP text, deprecated test references, inaccurate exclusions
- M-01~M-04: Recorded medium-priority items for future resolution

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- 11 issues found and fixed (2 Critical, 5 High, 4 Medium)
- Document quality grade improved from B to A-
- Strategy interface now has a single canonical definition
- Planned services clearly marked to avoid misleading new developers

**Negative**:
- 5 low-priority risk items remain open (R-01 through R-05)
- Audit is a point-in-time snapshot; consistency can drift again without ongoing discipline

## Artifacts

- Updated: VISION.md, SPEC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md, TEST.md, PHASE3-PLAN.md
- Created: DOC_AUDIT_REPORT.md (now archived)

## Metrics

| Document | Issues Found | Issues Fixed | Grade Change |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| VISION.md | 4 | 4 | A- → A |
| SPEC.md | 2 | 2 | B+ → A- |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | 2 | 2 | A- → A |
| ROADMAP.md | 1 | 1 | B+ → A- |
| TEST.md | 1 | 1 | B → B+ |
| PHASE3-PLAN.md | 1 | 1 | B+ → A- |

## Lessons Learned

- Cross-document consistency checks should be automated (e.g., Strategy interface signature comparison)
- "Planned" vs "Implemented" status must be explicitly marked in all specs
- Audit reports themselves become stale — convert findings into ADR/ODR for longevity
