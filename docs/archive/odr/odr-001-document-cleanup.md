## Context

The project had accumulated 26 markdown documents (5,363 lines) including AI-generated plans for abandoned architectures and outdated review reports. Key issues:

- `FRONTEND_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` described a BFF (Express) architecture that was never adopted
- `FRONTEND_REVIEW.md` reviewed legacy HTML that had been fully replaced by Vue SPA
- `PHASE2.5-REVIEW-PLAN.md` duplicated content now covered by NEXT_STEPS.md
- `memory/` directory contained temporary session logs no longer needed

## Decision

Delete 4 files and update 3 files to consolidate the documentation set:

- **Delete**: FRONTEND_REFACTOR_PLAN.md, FRONTEND_REVIEW.md, PHASE2.5-REVIEW-PLAN.md, memory/2026-03-26.md
- **Update**: README.md (2→87 lines), SPEC.md (Strategy interface fix), ARCHITECTURE.md (add frontend section)

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Document count reduced from 26 to 22 (-15%)
- Total lines reduced from 5,363 to 3,908 (-27%)
- Root directory cleaned to only README.md
- Strategy interface inconsistency fixed across VISION/SPEC/ARCHITECTURE

**Negative**:
- Historical context for deleted files is lost (mitigated by this ODR)
- 4 legacy issues remain open (D-01 through D-04)

## Artifacts

- Updated: README.md, SPEC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- Deleted: 4 files (see Context above)
- Created: CLEANUP_REPORT.md (now archived)

## Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Document count | 26 | 22 | -15% |
| Total lines | 5,363 | 3,908 | -27% |
| Root directory .md files | 3 | 1 | -67% |

## Lessons Learned

- AI-generated plans for unadopted architectures should be deleted promptly, not left in the repo
- Session logs (memory/) should be gitignored from the start
- When deleting docs, always create a trace record (now ODR) so the rationale isn't lost
