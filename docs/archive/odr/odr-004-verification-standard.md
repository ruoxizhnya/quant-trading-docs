## Context

After completing the AGENTS.md migration (ODR-003), a formal verification was needed to ensure the migration met quality standards. No existing verification framework was defined for document migration work.

## Decision

Define and apply a four-criterion verification standard for document migrations:

1. **Semantic Consistency** — Migrated content must be semantically identical to source material
2. **Completeness** — No content from the source may be missing in the migration
3. **No Extra Content** — No fabricated or unsourced content may be added
4. **Zero Impact** — Existing documents must not be modified or damaged

Applied this standard to verify the AGENTS.md migration with 25 specific checks across all sections.

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- All 4 criteria passed with 100% compliance
- 14/14 required sections present, 25/25 core elements verified
- Reusable verification framework for future migrations
- Formal "quality gate" for document governance work

**Negative**:
- Verification is manual and time-intensive (~3h for this migration)
- Point-in-time snapshot — doesn't guarantee ongoing consistency

## Artifacts

- Created: FINAL_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md (retained in docs/)
- Verified: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .session/, .gitignore

## Metrics

| Criterion | Result | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Semantic Consistency | ✅ Pass | 14/14 sections match research template |
| Completeness | ✅ Pass | 25/25 core elements present |
| No Extra Content | ✅ Pass | All content traceable to existing sources |
| Zero Impact | ✅ Pass | 22 existing docs unmodified |

## Lessons Learned

- Verification should be built into the migration process, not done after the fact
- A checklist approach (25 specific items) is more reliable than holistic review
- Verification reports themselves need lifecycle management — this one will be reviewed in 6 months
