## How to Find Archived Content

1. Check the corresponding **ODR file** in `docs/odr/` first — it contains the distilled decision record
2. If you need the full operational details, find the original report here
3. Use `git log -- docs/archive/` to see when files were archived

## Archival Policy

- Files are archived when their **active reference value drops below daily-use threshold**
- Archived files are **never deleted** — only moved here
- Archived files may have **outdated information** — always cross-reference with current code/docs
- Quarterly review: consider removing files archived > 12 months ago (requires maintainer approval)
