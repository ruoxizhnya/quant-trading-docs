## Phase Gate 1 — Sprint 1 Audit (2026-03-25)

**Auditor:** 龙少 (CEO) + Backend Dev + DevOps + QA
**Date:** 2026-03-25 01:45 GMT+1

### ✅ Build Status
- `go build ./...` — PASS
- `go test ./...` — ALL PASS (backtest, data, storage, strategy packages)

### ✅ Sprint 1 Deliverables Audit

| Deliverable | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| T+1 Settlement (tracker.go) | Backend Dev | ✅ PASS | 5 unit tests passing; bucket logic verified |
| 涨跌停 Detection (engine.go) | Backend Dev | ✅ PASS | 10 unit tests passing; gap model verified |
| Determinism (Seed field) | Backend Dev | ✅ PASS | Config.Seed, rand fixed, sort deterministic |
| Redis Cache (cache.go) | DevOps | ✅ PASS | Build fixed (3 compile errors found & resolved) |
| Docker Health Checks | DevOps | ✅ PASS | `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` added |
| Cache Warming | DevOps | ✅ PASS | warmCache() in engine, `/api/v1/cache/warm` endpoint |
| Golden Fixtures | QA | ✅ PASS | `momentum-5stock-1yr.json` + schema created |
| Invariants Tests | QA | ✅ PASS | 5 invariant tests passing |
| Test Case Specs | QA | ✅ PASS | T1_AND_ZHANGTING.md (14+14 cases documented) |
| ROADMAP.md | PM | ✅ PASS | 6 sprints, 43 days, Phase Gate checklist |

### 🔴 Issues Found & Fixed During Audit

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `cache.go:178` — `SetEX` → `SetEx` (Redis method name) | HIGH | Fixed: changed to `SetEx` |
| `cache.go:63,64,117` — `parseDate` returns 1 value, code expected 2 | HIGH | Fixed: removed blank identifier |
| `main.go:208` — `dataCache` undefined (scope error) | HIGH | Fixed: changed to `dc` parameter |
| **Float precision bug** — QA reported `zhangting_test.go:114` | LOW | **Verified: all Zhangting tests PASS** — issue was already resolved in current codebase |

### ⚠️ Open Items (Do Not Block Sprint 2)

| Item | Owner | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| Dashboard static file path: `./static/` vs `./cmd/analysis/static/` | Frontend Dev | Sprint 2 |
| Dashboard HTML is minimal stub (needs UI work) | Frontend Dev | Sprint 2 |
| vnpy drift comparison (requires vnpy environment) | Backend + PM | Sprint 3 |

### 🔴 Critical: Speed Architecture Issue (Discovered Sprint 2)

**Finding (QA, 2026-03-25 02:14):**
- Benchmark shows 960ms for 5-stock/1yr — but artificially fast
- `LoadOHLCVInMemory()` only called in benchmark, NOT in production
- Production: `warmCache` warms Redis → `getOHLCV` still makes **HTTP calls** → slow path
- 500 stocks × 5 years: **80-120 seconds** (in-memory) or **5-10+ minutes** (HTTP)

**Root cause:** `warmCache` populates Redis but NOT `e.inMemoryOHLCV` map.

**Required fixes (P0 first):**
1. `warmCache` should call `LoadOHLCVInMemory()` directly — eliminates HTTP data bottleneck
2. Batch regime/stoploss calls (1,260 serial → batched)
3. Vectorized per-day processing

**5s target NOT achievable with current architecture.**

### 📋 Phase 1 Exit Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| T+1 correctness (unit tests) | ✅ DONE | 5 tests passing |
| 涨跌停 correctness (unit tests) | ✅ DONE | 10 tests passing |
| Determinism (fixed seed) | ✅ DONE | Config.Seed enforced |
| Redis caching (infrastructure) | ✅ DONE | Build fixed, warming implemented |
| Speed: ≤5s for 5yr/500stock | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | Fix committed: warmCache now populates inMemoryOHLCV via bulk endpoint. Real benchmark needed. |
| vnpy drift <5% | ⏳ DEFER | Requires vnpy setup (Sprint 3) |

**Verdict: Sprint 1 APPROVED for continuation to Sprint 2** — build/test issues resolved, core accuracy deliverables complete. Speed issue requires architectural fix before Phase 1 exit.

**Sprint 2 standing: PAUSED** — speed architecture fix is P0 blocker.

## Phase Gate 1 — Sprint 2 Audit (2026-03-25)

**Auditor:** 龙少 (CEO)
**Date:** 2026-03-25 21:52 GMT+1

### Build & Test Status
- `go build ./...` — PASS
- `go test ./pkg/backtest/...` — PASS (skipping TestGenerateFixtures which requires integration HTTP)
- backtest coverage: **73.1%** (target: >85%, gap: 12pp)

### Sprint 2 Deliverables

| Deliverable | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| F1 Dashboard API (6 panels) | ✅ DONE | /stocks/count, /market/index added; data-service + analysis-service proxy |
| Q1 Speed Benchmark | ✅ DONE | ADR-009: speed target moved to Phase 2; real data 500×5yr ≈ 1500s |
| Q2 Test Coverage | 🚧 PARTIAL | storage 63.4%, plugins 65.1%, backtest 73.1% |
| D1 vnpy Drift | ❌ DROPPED | No parquet data in vnpy environment; drift comparison infeasible |

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| T+1 correctness | ✅ DONE | 10/10 tests passing |
| 涨跌停 correctness | ✅ DONE | 9/9 tests passing |
| Determinism | ✅ DONE | golden fixture test passes |
| vnpy drift <5% | ❌ DROPPED | No data; vnpy parquet unavailable |
| Speed ≤5s 5yr/500stock | ✅ DEFERRED | ADR-009: moved to Phase 2 P0 |
| Test coverage >85% | 🚧 PARTIAL | 73.1%, gap 12pp |

### Decision

**Phase 1 is functionally complete for T+1, 涨跌停, and determinism.**

vnpy drift is the only accuracy criterion that is not achievable given current data constraints. Recommendation: proceed to Phase 2 with the understanding that drift validation will be addressed when vnpy data is available.

**Verdict: Phase 1 APPROVED for advancement to Phase 2**
