## 1. Vision Statement

### 1.0 顶层定位（ADR-022）

> **一个 AI 投研研究员平台**：既能在全市场横向筛选（N 股 × 1 因子，日频，出信号），也能对单只股票纵向深挖（1 股 × N 季度，季度频，出研究档案），并且两者共享同一份数据、同一套证据链、同一组质量门禁。

它由**两个对等工作面**构成，共享下方的 L0-L2 三层：

```
        ┌──────────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────
        │  工作面 1：纵向深研    │   │  工作面 2：横截面选股  │
        │  1 股 × N 季度        │   │  N 股 × 1 因子        │
        │  产出：研究档案        │   │  产出：交易信号        │
        └──────────┬───────────   └──────────┬───────────┘
                   │      飞轮闭环 ①②↔③④      │
                   └───────────┬───────────────
                               ▼
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │  共享底座：唯一数据面 + 统一计算面 + 统一编排面      │
        │  （原 Quant Lab 的全部能力降维为此底座）            │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **共享底座**：数据面（L0 唯一事实源）+ 计算面（L1 因子/回测/验证/风控执行）+ 编排面（L2 Pipeline/Engine/工具桥）。
- **工作面 1（纵向深研）**：EquityDeep —— 本产品的**首要高层工作面**，详案见 [archive/RESEARCH-equitydeep-legacy.md](RESEARCH-equitydeep-legacy.md)。
- **工作面 2（横截面选股）**：原 Quant Lab 的横截面能力，与工作面 1 **对等**。
- **飞轮闭环**是"一个产品"的判据：纵向深挖产假设 → 横截面回测验证 → 结果回流修正理解 → 异常触发深挖。护城河是积累的研究资产（档案 + 因子 + 对应关系），而非单点技术。

> **本文档余下内容（§1.1 起）描述的是"共享底座 + 工作面 2"的能力与设计原则。** 顶层产品定义以 [PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md) 为准；四层架构与数据分区以 [ARCHITECTURE.md §统一研究平台架构](../ARCHITECTURE.md) 与 [ADR-022](superseded-adr/adr-022-unified-research-platform.md) 为准。

### 1.1 What is this system (底座 + 工作面 2 视角)

**What is this system?**

A professional-grade quantitative trading platform built in Go, delivering institutional-quality multi-factor strategy execution, live backtesting, and AI-assisted strategy development — with A-share (Chinese stock market) as its first and primary target, and a fully market-agnostic core architecture underneath.

**Who is it for?**

Individual investors with some trading experience who want more than intuition — they want evidence. The platform is designed to be powerful enough for serious quant work, yet accessible enough that a non-programmer can describe a strategy in plain Chinese and have the AI generate working code.

**What problem does it solve?**

Most quant tools are either:
- Too simple (Excel backtests, inaccurate)
- Too complex (vnpy, JoinQuant — overwhelming for individuals)
- Too closed (米筐, Wind — expensive, no control)
- Too slow (Python-based systems hitting GIL limitations)

This system solves that gap: a fast, open, self-hosted platform where strategies are plugins you can swap without rebuilding, AI helps you write new strategies, and every number is traceable back to its source.

**What makes it different?**

Five things set this apart:
1. **Go-native performance** — backtests that run in seconds, not minutes
2. **Hot-swappable strategy plugins** — add a new strategy by dropping a file, no rebuild, no restart
3. **AI Copilot integration** — describe a strategy in natural language, get working Go code with tests
4. **AI-Native Evolution** — AI acts as a senior quant researcher: discovers factors, generates strategies, evolves populations, detects drift
5. **Unified Execution** — same interface for backtest, paper trading, and live trading; swap execution mode without changing strategy code

---

## 2. Core Principles

These principles inform every decision — from database schema to feature prioritization. They are derived from SOUL.md (authentic helpfulness, ownership mindset), AGENTS.md (delegate, be resourceful), and the hard lessons learned from vnpy and earlier prototypes.

### Principle 1: Accuracy Before Features

A backtest that is 5% wrong is worse than no backtest — it creates false confidence. T+1 settlement enforcement, correct commission splitting (stamp tax is sell-only), 涨跌停 detection, and 前复权 data are not nice-to-haves. They are the product. We ship features that are correct, not features that are fast to build.

**What this means in practice:** Phase 1 is entirely devoted to data accuracy and A-share rule compliance. No feature work proceeds until T+1 settlement, trading calendar, 涨跌停 detection, and commission structure are verified against vnpy's proven implementation.

### Principle 2: Market-Agnostic Core, Market-Specific Periphery

The strategy interface, backtest engine, risk manager, and execution layer must never know or care whether they are running on A-shares, US equities, or Bitcoin. All market-specific logic — trading hours, T+1 rules, price limits, commission schedules, margin rates — lives exclusively in the data layer and configuration layer.

**What this means:** Adding US equities support should require zero changes to the backtest engine or strategy plugins. Only a new data adapter and a new config file.

### Principle 3: Hot-Swap Everything

Strategies are plugins. Risk models can be swapped. Data sources can change. Nothing should require a service restart. The system is designed for dynamic runtime loading from the start, not bolted on as an afterthought.

**What this means:** The `Strategy` interface is the contract. The `Registry` is the runtime graph. Plugins register themselves via `init()`. The engine resolves strategies by name at runtime. A user can add a new momentum strategy tomorrow by writing one file and reloading — no PR, no deploy.

### Principle 4: Performance Is a Feature

We chose Go for a reason. Backtests that take 5 seconds enable the kind of rapid iteration that makes Python-based systems feel painful. The system must remain fast as it scales: 5,000 stocks, 10 years of data, complex multi-factor scoring. Performance is a competitive advantage, not an infrastructure concern.

**What this means:** No Python in the hot path. Async I/O for data fetching. TimescaleDB for time-series queries. In-memory caching for active backtest sessions.

### Principle 5: AI as a First-Class User

龙少 (the AI assistant) is not a chatbot bolted onto the side. It is the interface through which strategies are created, evaluated, and improved. The user talks to 龙少; 龙少 talks to the trading system. The goal is not "AI assists human using a GUI" — it is "AI and human collaborate as a team, each doing what they do best."

**What this means:** Every system component is designed to be readable and actionable by an AI. Strategy code must follow conventions that AI can understand and modify. Error messages must be actionable. Logs must be structured and traceable.

### Principle 6: Own Your Data, Own Your System

No subscription. No data vendor lock-in. The system runs locally, on your machine or your VPS. Tushare is the current data source, but the architecture abstracts data access behind a `MarketData` interface — swap to Wind, Bloomberg, or a custom scraper without touching strategy or execution code.

**What this means:** Self-hosted Docker Compose for development, Kubernetes-ready for production. No proprietary data formats. All schemas documented in code and in VISION.md.

### Principle 7: Evidence Over Intuition

Every trading decision in the system is backed by a backtest. Every strategy is evaluated on historical data before consideration. Intuition is welcome as a starting hypothesis — but it is not accepted as a final answer. The system exists to pressure-test intuition with data.

**What this means:** The dashboard always shows backtest results alongside any live suggestion. A strategy that looks good in a chat with 龙少 must still pass through the backtest engine before being taken seriously.

### Principle 8: Documentation-Path Consistency

Any ADR, ODR, or TASKS document that references a file path **must** match the actual project layout. Line numbers must be verified with `grep -n` or Read tools — not invented. The cost of an inaccurate path reference is real: a developer following a stale reference wastes time, and the trust in the documentation erodes.

**What this means:**

1. **Path references must match actual directories.** When writing `cmd/risk/` vs `cmd/risk-service/`, the document must reflect what `ls` actually shows. Service names (docker-compose `service.name`) and code directory names (`cmd/<short>/`) are distinct concerns; documents should prefer the code directory name and note the service name separately.

2. **Line number references must be verified.** Use `grep -n` or the Read tool before quoting `pkg/foo/bar.go:123`. If the line has drifted (code evolved), say "verify current line" rather than asserting an exact number.

3. **Newly-created files must be labeled.** Any path like `pkg/storage/integration_test.go` that does not yet exist must be marked `(新建)` so the reader knows it is a future artifact, not an existing one.

4. **All path references are auditable.** During the ODR-013 alignment review (2026-06-11), 4 of 73 Sprint 6 task descriptions contained path drift (e.g., `cmd/risk-service/` vs `cmd/risk/`, "10+ setters" vs. the actual 5+1+4=10). Future audits will continue to check this.

## 3. Feature Breakdown by Category

### A. Data Layer

**What data do we have?**
- OHLCV daily bars (前复权, qfq-adjusted) for ~5,500 A-share stocks — via tushare.pro `stk_factor_pro` API
- Stock master list: symbol, name, exchange, industry, market cap, status
- Fundamental data: PE, PB, PS, ROE, ROA, debt-to-equity, gross/net margin, revenue/net profit growth
- Trading calendar: exchange + date + is_trading_day — from tushare `trade_cal` API

**What data do we need?**
- **Dividend history** — for tracking dividend income and split-adjusted returns (tushare `dividend` API)
- **Split/rights issue history** — for verifying forward-adjustment calculations (tushare `split` API)
- **Index constituents** — for building universe pools (CSI 300, CSI 500) (tushare `index_weight` API)
- **Limit-up/limit-down history** — for 涨跌停 detection (derived from daily high/low vs previous close, but needs explicit flagging)
- **Margin trading data** — short interest, margin balance (tushare `margin` API) — needed for short strategy modeling
- **Analyst estimates and ratings** — price targets, rating changes (tushare `analyst_estimate` API)
- **News headlines** — for sentiment factor (crawl 东方财富, 同花顺, or use tushare `news` API)

**How should it be stored and accessed?**
- PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB: OHLCV as hypertable partitioned by time, stock fundamentals with symbol+date PK
- `trading_calendar` table: (exchange, cal_date) PK, is_open boolean — authoritative source for backtest iteration
- `factor_cache` table: pre-computed factor scores (momentum, value quintile, etc.) keyed by (symbol, date, factor_name) — avoids recalculating 5 years of z-scores on every backtest
- Data service (port 8081) exposes HTTP API for all data queries — backtest engine never talks to DB directly
- Redis: hot caching for frequently accessed OHLCV and fundamental data within active backtest sessions

---

### B. Strategy Layer

**How are strategies created, managed, executed?**

Strategies implement the `Strategy` interface — a composite of 4 ISP
single-responsibility sub-interfaces (P1-24, ADR-020 §6, ODR-013 CQ-006):
> **Canonical definition** — matches [pkg/strategy/interfaces.go](../pkg/strategy/interfaces.go)
```go
// 4 个 single-responsibility 子接口
type StrategyCore interface {
    Name() string
    Description() string
}
type Configurable interface {
    Parameters() []Parameter
    Configure(params map[string]interface{}) error
}
type SignalGenerator interface {
    GenerateSignals(ctx context.Context,
        bars map[string][]domain.OHLCV,
        portfolio *domain.Portfolio) ([]domain.Signal, error)
    Weight(signal domain.Signal, portfolioValue float64) float64
}
type ResourceManaged interface {
    Cleanup()
}

// 复合接口 (向后兼容, 7 方法 surface 不变)
type Strategy interface {
    StrategyCore
    Configurable
    SignalGenerator
    ResourceManaged
}
```

> **P1-24 (ODR-013 CQ-006)**: Strategy 原 7 方法单一接口违反 Interface
> Segregation Principle (parameterless 策略被迫实现空 stub Parameters/Configure,
> 只读策略被迫实现 no-op Cleanup)。拆分后 `Configurable`/`ResourceManaged`
> 标记 optional, BaseStrategy 提供默认实现, 具体策略按需选择。
> 9 个 compliance 测试覆盖所有 builtin 策略 + As* 类型下转 helper。

Strategies live in `pkg/strategy/plugins/` and auto-register via `init()`. A strategy config (YAML) provides parameters at runtime. The engine resolves strategies by name from the `GlobalRegistry`.

**Signal → Trade pipeline:**
1. Engine iterates to trading day D
2. `Strategy.GenerateSignals()` returns `[]domain.Signal` for universe
3. Risk service adjusts signal weights based on portfolio volatility and regime
4. `Tracker.ExecuteTrade()` converts signal to trade, respecting T+1, position limits, 涨跌停
5. Portfolio updated; daily NAV recorded

**What strategy types should be supported?**

| Type | Examples | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Momentum | 20-day price momentum, 12M reversal | ✅ momentum.go exists |
| Value | PE/PB/PS screening, composite value score | ✅ value_momentum.go exists |
| Multi-Factor | Value + Momentum + Quality composite | ✅ multi_factor.go exists (live computation; Factor cache needed for production-scale multi-factor evaluation) |
| Mean Reversion | Bollinger bands, RSI thresholds | ✅ mean_reversion.go (Bollinger + RSI) |
| Risk Parity | Volatility-adjusted equal risk contribution | ✅ risk_parity.go (1/vol weighting) |
| Event-Driven | Earnings surprises, analyst upgrades | ✅ event_driven.go (price jump + volume spike proxy) |
| Sentiment | News/algo sentiment scoring | ✅ sentiment.go (contrarian, uses SentimentAggregator) |
| AI-Generated | LLM-generated strategies from natural language | ✅ Phase 4 — Generate Agent + Code Validator |
| Evolutionary | Genetic algorithm evolved strategies | ✅ Phase 4 — Evolve Agent + Population framework |

### C. Execution Layer

**ExecutionService abstraction (Phase 4):**
- `ExecutionService` interface in `pkg/domain/execution.go` unifies backtest, paper, and live trading
- `BacktestExecutionService` in `pkg/backtest/execution.go` implements the interface for backtesting
- `LiveEngine` in `pkg/live/engine.go` orchestrates live trading with Broker, OrderManager, PositionManager, DataFeed
- `MockTrader` in `pkg/live/mock_trader.go` provides paper trading with A-share rules (T+1, stamp tax, price limits)
- `SimulatedBroker` in `pkg/live/simulated_broker.go` simulates broker behavior for paper trading

**Order management, position tracking:**
- `Tracker` struct in `pkg/backtest/tracker.go` is the execution engine within each backtest
- `target_position` vs `actual_position` separation (vnpy pattern) — strategy generates target, execution fills gap to actual
- Partial fills modeled: if order quantity > available liquidity, partial fill at limit price
- Order types: market (executed at close), limit (executed if price crosses threshold)
- Order log: every attempted order with reason, filled quantity, price, fees

**Live Trading Interfaces:**
```go
// LiveTrader — core interface for all broker implementations
type LiveTrader interface {
    SubmitOrder(ctx context.Context, symbol string, direction Direction, orderType OrderType, quantity, price float64) (*OrderResult, error)
    CancelOrder(ctx context.Context, orderID string) error
    GetOrder(ctx context.Context, orderID string) (*OrderResult, error)
    GetPositions(ctx context.Context) ([]Position, error)
    GetAccount(ctx context.Context) (*Account, error)
}

// Broker — interface for order execution
 type Broker interface {
     Connect() error
     Disconnect() error
     SubmitOrder(order domain.Order) (string, error)
     CancelOrder(orderID string) error
     GetOrderStatus(orderID string) (string, error)
     GetPositions() ([]domain.Position, error)
     GetAccountBalance() (float64, error)
 }
```

**Position tracking:**
```go
type Position struct {
    Symbol           string
    Quantity         float64    // Total shares
    QuantityYesterday float64   // Shares held since yesterday (can sell today)
    QuantityToday    float64    // Shares bought today (T+1 locked)
    AvgCost          float64
    BuyDate          map[int]float64  // share_count by trading_day — for T+1 enforcement
}
```

**Commission / fee handling (A-share):**
- Commission: 0.03% per side, minimum 5 CNY per trade
- Stamp tax: 0.1% on sell side only (印花税)
- Transfer fee: 0.001% both sides (过户费)
- Slippage: 0.01% per trade (configurable) — models market impact of order size
- Short selling: margin interest rate ~10.6% annual (configurable)

**T+1 Settlement:**
- Shares bought on day D cannot be sold until day D+1 (at minimum)
- `QuantityYesterday` tracks sellable shares; `QuantityToday` tracks locked shares
- Capital used to buy today is locked until positions are sold (buying power check)
- YD bucket (昨日持仓可卖) vs TD bucket (今日买入不可卖) — vnpy's OffsetConverter pattern

**Price limit (涨跌停) detection:**
- Limit-up: if `(high - prev_close) / prev_close >= 0.10` → no new buys that day
- Limit-down: if `(low - prev_close) / prev_close <= -0.10` → no new sells that day
- ST stocks: ±5% limits
- Price resumes from limit level on next trading day (gap model)

---

### D. Analytics Layer

**Backtesting engine:**
- Go-native, single-process, goroutine-parallel for multi-stock universes
- Engine flow: Init → Load Data → Daily Loop (regime → signals → risk → execution → record) → Finalize → Report
- Supports intraday rebalancing (weekly/monthly thresholds configurable)
- Equity curve: daily NAV for every trading day in range
- Trade log: every order with timestamp, symbol, direction, quantity, price, fees, PnL

**Performance metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Total Return | (final_nav / initial_nav - 1) | > 50% (5yr) |
| Annualized Return | (1 + total_return)^(252/days) - 1 | > 10% |
| Sharpe Ratio | (annualized_return - risk_free) / annual_vol | > 1.5 |
| Max Drawdown | max(peak - nav) / peak | < 15% |
| Calmar Ratio | annualized_return / max_drawdown | > 1.0 |
| Win Rate | winning_trades / total_trades | > 55% |
| Profit Factor | gross_profit / gross_loss | > 1.5 |
| Avg Holding Days | sum(holding_days) / num_trades | benchmark-dependent |
| Turnover | total_traded_value / (2 × portfolio_value) | < 100% annually |

**Factor analysis:**
- Factor returns: measure return of top quintile vs bottom quintile for each factor
- Factor correlation matrix: prevent stacking correlated factors
- IC (Information Coefficient): rank correlation between factor value and forward returns — `pkg/ai/metrics/ic.go`
- Turnover analysis: factor stability and rebalancing cost estimation — `pkg/ai/metrics/turnover.go`
- Multi-factor attribution: decompose portfolio return into factor contributions
- Factor decay analysis: how quickly factor predictive power diminishes (1M, 3M, 6M)

**AI-specific analytics (Phase 4):**
- Factor gene pool performance tracking: IC history, Sharpe, turnover per factor gene
- Strategy genealogy: parent-child relationships, generational fitness progression
- Population diversity metrics: genetic diversity, convergence detection
- Drift detection: rolling window monitoring for strategy degradation — `pkg/ai/drift/detector.go`
- Walk-forward validation: train/validate splits for overfitting prevention — `pkg/ai/search/walkforward.go`

**Docker / services:**
- `docker-compose.yml` defines 5 services (ODR-021): postgres (TimescaleDB image), redis, analysis-service (incl. in-process risk + execution), data-service, strategy-service. AI research service runs separately via `cmd/ai/main.go`.
- Each Go service is a separate Docker container
- Volume mounts for data persistence and config
- `Dockerfile.service` multi-stage build: Go build → minimal distroless image
- Kubernetes manifests (future): HPA, PodDisruptionBudget, resource limits, readiness/liveness probes

**Monitoring / logging:**
- Structured logging via zerolog (JSON to stdout, parsed by Docker log driver)
- Request IDs propagated across all service calls
- `/health` endpoint on every service
- Metrics endpoint (Prometheus format, future): backtest duration, data sync lag, API latency
- Alerting (future): PagerDuty for backtest failures, data sync stalls

## 4.5 Phase Plan

The phases below define the build order. All P0 items must be fully done (not "in progress") before advancing to the next phase.

### Phase 1 — Foundation & Accuracy ✅ DONE
**Goal:** Get the numbers right. Every subsequent phase depends on trustworthy backtest results.

| Category | P0 Deliverables |
|----------|-----------------|
| Data | Trading calendar sync ✅/🔄, T+1 settlement enforcement 🔄, 涨跌停 detection 🔄 |
| Execution | T+1 position buckets 🔄 |
| UI | Dashboard 🔄 |
| Infrastructure | Redis caching 🔄 (P0 — for speed optimization, see ADR-009) |

**Exit criteria — all must pass before Phase 2:**
1. **Accuracy:** ~~5-year, 500-stock backtest matches vnpy output within 5% drift~~ — **DROPPED**: vnpy parquet data unavailable; replaced with T+1 + 涨跌停 unit tests proving correctness
2. **T+1 correctness:** Unit tests prove same-day sell blocked; next-day sell succeeds ✅
3. **涨跌停 correctness:** Unit tests prove limit-up blocks buys, limit-down blocks sells; ST stocks ±5% limits enforced ✅
4. **Determinism:** Same seed → same results (fixed random seed enforced in backtest engine) ✅

> ⚠️ **Speed target moved to Phase 2** — see ADR-009. Current measured speed (~1500s for 500×5yr) is ~300× too slow. Speed optimization is a Phase 2 P0. Phase 1 focuses exclusively on accuracy.

**Phase Gate Review:** Before advancing to Phase 2, run the full Phase 1 acceptance test suite (see `docs/TEST.md`). All tests must pass. Record results in `docs/phase-gate-reviews.md`.

### Phase 2 — Reliability & Copilot ✅ DONE
**Goal:** Make the system robust enough for daily use and introduce AI assistance.

| Category | Deliverables |
|----------|-------------|
| Data | Dividend data sync, split/rights issue, index constituents, factor cache |
| Strategy | Mean reversion strategy, hot-swap loading, strategy DB config |
| Execution | Limit order support, partial fill modeling, target/actual position separation |
| Analytics | Factor attribution, IC analysis, strategy comparison UI, walk-forward validation |
| UI | Strategy selector UI, backtest comparison UI, Strategy Copilot |
| Infrastructure | Speed optimization P0 (in-memory pre-load, TimescaleDB chunking, parallel warmCache — see ADR-009); background backtest worker |

**Exit criteria — all must pass before Phase 3:**
1. **Speed:** 500-stock, 5-year backtest completes in ≤ 5 seconds (Phase 2 P0 target — ADR-009)
2. **Factor Cache:** Multi-factor backtest (100 stocks, 3 years) completes in ≤ 30 seconds (via pre-computed factor scores)
3. **Strategy Copilot:** End-to-end test: user submits Chinese description → receives compilable Go code → backtest runs → results displayed — all in one session; ≥ 30% acceptance rate
4. **Walk-forward validation:** Framework operational; all Phase 3 candidate strategies must pass train/validate split before entering paper trading
5. **Background worker:** `POST /backtest` returns `job_id` immediately; worker runs async; client can poll `/backtest/:id`
5. **Strategy DB config:** `strategies` table with JSONB column operational; YAML import/export functional

### Phase 3 — AI-Native Evolution ✅ DONE
**Goal:** AI acts as a senior quantitative researcher — autonomously discovering alpha factors, generating trading strategies, and validating hypotheses through the existing backtest infrastructure.

| Category | Deliverables | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| AI | **Research Agent** (factor discovery via LLM) | ✅ `pkg/ai/agents/research.go` |
| AI | **Generate Agent** (strategy code generation) | ✅ `pkg/ai/agents/generate.go` |
| AI | **Validate Agent** (L1-L4 validation pipeline) | ✅ `pkg/ai/agents/validate.go` |
| AI | **Evolve Agent** (genetic algorithm + drift detection) | ✅ `pkg/ai/agents/evolve.go` |
| AI | ~~**Optimize Agent** (TPE + genetic search hybrid)~~ | ️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** ️ — `pkg/ai/agents/optimize.go` 从未创建 (TPE/遗传算法在 `pkg/ai/search/`, 无 agent 包装层; 见本文「AI Components (Backend)」章节) |
| Expression | **Factor Expression DSL** (custom DSL with AST evaluation, A-share specific operators) | ✅ `pkg/ai/expression/` |
| Gene Pool | **Factor/Strategy Gene Pool** (PostgreSQL JSONB, genealogy tracking, performance history) | ✅ `pkg/ai/gene_pool/` |
| Search | **TPE Bayesian optimization** | ✅ `pkg/ai/search/tpe.go` |
| Search | **Genetic algorithm** | ✅ `pkg/ai/search/genetic.go` |
| Search | **Walk-Forward validation** | ✅ `pkg/ai/search/walkforward.go` |
| Evolution | **Population management, selection, crossover, mutation** | ✅ `pkg/ai/evolution/` |
| Drift | **Concept drift detection** | ✅ `pkg/ai/drift/detector.go` |
| Analytics | Factor decay analysis, IC time series, Walk-Forward validation | ✅ `pkg/ai/metrics/` |

| Execution | **LiveEngine** (event-driven live trading) | ✅ `pkg/live/engine.go` |

**Key Design Principle:** AI is an augmentation layer, not a replacement. The existing backtest engine, data pipeline, and strategy framework remain the foundational assets. AI Agents call the backtest service for validation, ensuring consistency and leveraging A-share specific rules (T+1, limit up/down).

**Exit criteria — all must pass before Phase 4:**
1. **AI Agent tests:** Core sub-packages (agents/expression/search/evolution) have meaningful unit-test coverage (avg ~67%, range 16-95%); top-level `pkg/ai` entrypoints have 0% coverage — the Phase 4 子包优先 / 顶层滞后模式为已知技术债 (CR-34, ODR-012)
2. **Expression engine:** Can parse and evaluate `ts_mean(close, 20)` and `cs_rank(ts_std(returns, 60))` ✅
3. **Gene pool persistence:** Factor and strategy genes stored in PostgreSQL with JSONB metadata ✅
4. **Validation pipeline:** L1-L4 validation operational (syntax → quick eval → backtest → walk-forward) ✅
5. **Evolution loop:** 50-strategy population with selection, crossover, mutation, and convergence detection ✅
6. **Paper trading:** End-to-end paper trading with A-share fees and T+1 settlement ✅

**Prerequisites to start Phase 3:** All Phase 1 P0 items complete; all Phase 2 exit criteria passed (see Phase 2 gate); Phase 2 acceptance test suite recorded in `docs/phase-gate-reviews.md`; ADR-015 approved.

### Phase 4 — Scale & Production (Current)

## 5. Architecture Decisions to Make

These are the open questions that require explicit decisions before the system can move from Phase 2 to Phase 3. Each has two or more viable options with tradeoffs.

### Decision 1: Dynamic Plugin Loading vs. Compiled Strategies

**Question:** Should strategies be loaded at runtime from `.so` plugin files (true hot-swap), or from Go source files compiled into the binary (safer, simpler)?

**Option A — Compiled strategies (current state):**
Strategies live in `pkg/strategy/plugins/` and are imported via `import _ "pkg/strategy/plugins"` at startup. Adding a strategy requires recompiling the binary. Hot-swap is achieved by swapping config files and restarting the service.
- ✅ Simple, type-safe, no `plugin` package complexity
- ✅ Full IDE support, Go compiler catches errors
- ❌ Requires restart to load new strategy
- ❌ Can't add strategy without rebuilding the binary

**Option B — Runtime plugin (`.so` files):**
Define a `Strategy` interface, compile strategies as `.so` plugins, load via Go's `plugin` package at runtime. Drop a new `.so` file, hit reload endpoint, new strategy is live.
- ✅ True hot-swap: no restart, no rebuild
- ✅ Users can add strategies without touching core binary
- ❌ `plugin` package is fragile across Go versions; limited OS support (no Windows)
- ❌ Debugging plugin code is painful
- ❌ Loses type safety across plugin boundary

**Recommendation:** **Option A (compiled)** for v1 and v2. The architecture is already "hot-swap" at the config level — swapping strategy parameters via YAML achieves most practical benefit. True `.so` hot-swap can be revisited when there is a clear user need. The `StrategyRegistry` abstraction means the switch to Option B would only require implementing a `StrategyLoader` interface — the hard architectural work is already done.

---

### Decision 2: TimescaleDB vs. Vanilla PostgreSQL for OHLCV Storage

**Question:** Should OHLCV data use TimescaleDB's hypertable partitioning, or standard PostgreSQL partitioned tables?

**Option A — TimescaleDB (current):**
`CREATE TABLE ohlcv_daily (...) WITH (timescaledb.continuous);` — TimescaleDB automatically partitions by time, enables compression, and provides efficient time-range queries.
- ✅ Native time-series optimization; chunk-based compression reduces storage 90%+
- ✅ Continuous aggregate queries (e.g., "last 30 days average volume") are fast
- ✅ `time_bucket()` function makes rolling window queries elegant
- ❌ TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension; adds operational complexity
- ❌ License considerations for production use (TimescaleDB source available, but TimescaleDB binary has a source-available license with some closed-source features)
- ❌ Backup/restore is slightly more complex

**Option B — Vanilla PostgreSQL with native partitioning:**
Use PostgreSQL's native `PARTITION BY RANGE (trade_date)` — one partition per year or per month.
- ✅ Zero additional dependencies; uses only PostgreSQL
- ✅ Full SQL flexibility
- ✅ Easier operational simplicity
- ❌ No built-in compression
- ❌ Manual partition management (create new partitions, detach old ones)

**Recommendation:** **Option A (TimescaleDB)** — it is already running in production. The compression and time-series query performance are worth the operational complexity for a data-intensive system like this. If license concerns arise in a commercial context, migration to native partitioning is a one-week project with no architectural changes.

---

### Decision 3: In-Process Backtest vs. Separate Backtest Worker Service

**Question:** Should the backtest engine run in-process (same goroutine as the API server), or as a separate worker process with a job queue?

**Option A — In-process (current):**
`POST /backtest` blocks the HTTP handler, engine runs in same process, result returned when complete.
- ✅ Simplest to implement; no IPC overhead
- ✅ Full access to in-memory strategy registry and data cache
- ✅ Easy to debug; stack traces are immediate
- ❌ Long backtests (5+ years, 5,000 stocks) block the API server
- ❌ Cannot run multiple backtests in parallel from same instance
- ❌ Backtest crash can crash the API server

**Option B — Background worker with job queue:**
`POST /backtest` creates a job, returns `job_id` immediately. Worker process picks up job, runs backtest, writes result to DB. Client polls `/backtest/:id/status`.
- ✅ API server is never blocked
- ✅ Multiple backtests run in parallel
- ✅ Backtest crash is isolated
- ✅ Enables remote worker (GPU backtest machine, etc.)
- ❌ Adds infrastructure: job queue (Redis or PostgreSQL-backed), worker service
- ❌ Results must be persisted to DB between steps (cannot keep state in memory)
- ❌ Polling or WebSocket for status adds complexity

**Recommendation:** **Option B (background worker)** — but not immediately. The current in-process approach is fine for v1 where the target is single backtests under 30 seconds. The migration should happen when the system needs to support: (a) multiple concurrent users, (b) backtests longer than 1 minute, or (c) batch strategy optimization (walk-forward analysis). Implement as: `backtest_jobs` table gets a `status` column; engine gains a `--worker` flag.

---

### Decision 4: Single Factor Score vs. Portfolio Optimizer for Position Sizing

**Question:** Should the system continue using rank-based composite scoring (current approach: sort stocks by weighted factor score, top N get equal weight), or migrate to formal portfolio optimization (mean-variance optimization / risk parity)?

**Option A — Rank-based equal weight (current):**
Sort universe by composite factor score, select top N, assign equal weight to each.
- ✅ Simple, interpretable, no estimation error in return forecasts
- ✅ Robust: doesn't require predicting returns, only ranking
- ✅ Fast: O(n log n) sort, no matrix inversion
- ❌ Ignores correlations between positions
- ❌ Ignores individual position volatility (treats high-vol and low-vol equally)
- ❌ No formal risk budgeting

**Option B — Portfolio optimization (MVO or risk parity):**
Use mean-variance optimization or risk parity to compute weights that minimize portfolio variance for a given return target.
- ✅ Theoretically sound: uses covariance matrix
- ✅ Enables risk parity (equal risk contribution per position)
- ✅ Handles correlation: diversification benefit is real
- ❌ Requires estimated returns — garbage in, garbage out (error maximization problem)
- ❌ Computationally heavier; covariance matrix estimation is noisy with small universes
- ❌ MVO produces corner solutions (all weight in one asset) without regularization

**Recommendation:** **Keep Option A for now, add Option B as a configuration choice.** The rank-based approach is correct for factor-based long-only strategies, which is 90% of this system's use case. Portfolio optimization should be added as an alternative `WeightScheme` in the Risk service. Users who want MVO can enable it; users who want simplicity use rank-based. Both should share the same signal generation pipeline.

---

### Decision 5: YAML Strategy Config vs. Database-Driven Strategy Config

**Question:** Should strategy parameters be stored in YAML files (current approach) or in the PostgreSQL database?

**Option A — YAML files (current):**
Strategy parameters in `config/strategies/*.yaml`, loaded at startup via Viper.
- ✅ Version controllable (git)
- ✅ Easy to edit without DB access
- ✅ No migration needed when params change
- ✅ Works well with config hot-reload
- ❌ No runtime visibility: cannot query "what parameters is strategy X using right now?" from API
- ❌ Hard to do A/B testing of strategy params without file juggling

**Option B — Database-backed:**
Strategy parameters stored in `strategies` table with JSONB column for config. API for CRUD operations.
- ✅ Full audit trail of parameter changes
- ✅ Runtime queryable: `/api/strategies/:name/config`
- ✅ Enables A/B testing (assign parameter set A vs B to users)
- ✅ Works naturally with multi-tenant (future)
- ❌ More infrastructure; migration scripts for schema changes
- ❌ Requires API for config management (more code)

**Recommendation:** **Option B — database-backed** as the primary store, with YAML as an import/export format. The system is already backed by PostgreSQL; adding a `strategies` table is trivial. Keep YAML for initial seeding and backup/export. The key insight: the backtest engine doesn't care where config comes from — the `StrategyLoader` reads from a common interface. So the DB can be the source of truth while YAML remains a convenient human-editable format.

**Migration plan (see Strategy DB config in Strategy Layer feature table):** Add `strategies` table with JSONB config column and CRUD API in Strategy service. Existing YAML configs remain importable. No changes to backtest engine or Strategy interface required — only `StrategyLoader` implementation swaps.

## 6. Success Metrics

These are the metrics that matter — not test coverage percentages or lines of code, but whether the system is actually useful, accurate, and worth a trader's time.

### Product Outcomes

| Metric | Definition | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Backtest accuracy | Backtest return vs. actual historical portfolio return (where comparable) | < 5% drift | Compare against vnpy run on same strategy/dates |
| Strategy count | Number of distinct strategies users have run through the system | 5+ by end of Phase 2 | DB query of `backtest_jobs` by strategy name |
| Backtest speed | Time from "click Run" to results displayed for 1yr/500 stock backtest | < 5 seconds | Server-side timing in backtest response |
| Data freshness | Age of latest OHLCV data in DB (business days behind) | < 2 business days | Compare `max(trade_date)` in DB vs. trading calendar |
| User adoption | Unique users who run a backtest per week | Growing | `backtest_jobs.created_by` per week |
| Strategy sharability | Number of custom strategies shared by users (future) | > 0 by Phase 3 | Custom strategy table count |

### Financial Performance (Backtest Targets)

These are the targets for strategies run through the system. They are not guarantees — they are the bar that a strategy must clear before being taken seriously.

| Metric | Target | Context |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Sharpe Ratio | > 1.5 | Risk-adjusted return; the minimum for institutional-grade |
| Max Drawdown | < 15% | Avoid catastrophic losses |
| Annualized Return | > 10% | Beat simple index (CSI 300 baseline) |
| Calmar Ratio | > 1.0 | Return per unit of max drawdown |
| Win Rate | > 55% | Per trade, not per day |
| Profit Factor | > 1.5 | Gross profit / gross loss |

### Technical Health

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| API uptime | > 99.5% | Uptime monitoring on health endpoints |
| Data sync reliability | Every scheduled sync completes without error | Sync job logs |
| Backtest reproducibility | Same inputs → same outputs (deterministic) | Regression test suite |
| Test coverage | > 80% line coverage on core packages | `go test -cover` |
| Paper vs. backtest drift | < 10% difference in total return | Run paper trade alongside backtest |

### Usage Quality

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Strategy survival rate | Strategies that pass backtest continue to beat benchmark over time | > 40% at 6 months |
| User retention | Users who run >1 backtest per month | > 50% month-over-month |
| AI strategy acceptance rate | % of AI-generated strategies that pass code review and backtest | > 30% |

## Appendix: Document Relationships

> **ADR-022 起，顶层事实源为 [PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md)**（顶层产品定义：一个产品 + 两个对等工作面 + 一个共享底座）。本文档降为**设计原则与特性清单**（描述"共享底座 + 工作面 2"），位于 PRODUCT.md 之下、SPEC/ARCHITECTURE 之上。

This document is the **canonical source for design principles and the feature inventory** of the base + workstation 2 (横截面). It is derived from and relates to:

- [PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md) — 顶层产品定义（**上游，优先级更高**）
- [ADR-022](superseded-adr/adr-022-unified-research-platform.md) — 统一研究平台架构决策
- [archive/RESEARCH-equitydeep-legacy.md](RESEARCH-equitydeep-legacy.md) — 工作面 1（纵向深研）详案
- `ROADMAP.md` — tactical implementation roadmap (what to build next)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — technical architecture (how it is built)
- `SPEC.md` — detailed system specification and interfaces
- `ADR.md` + `docs/adr/` — architectural decision records
- `archive/NEXT_STEPS.md` — archived audit findings (read-only)

When this document conflicts with PRODUCT.md or ADR-022, those take precedence; VISION.md should be updated to match them. Against ROADMAP/ARCHITECTURE/SPEC, this document takes precedence — they should be updated to match this document.

**Change process:** To propose a change to VISION.md, write the rationale and submit for review. Changes require understanding of both the product vision and the technical constraints. No single feature addition should contradict the Core Principles.

### 自动进化流程

1. **目标设定**（人类）
   - "帮我找到年化收益 > 20%，最大回撤 < 15% 的 A 股策略"
   - 或者更简单："找低估值高ROE的价值股策略"
   - 人类 also sets constraints: max leverage, max single-position weight, forbidden asset classes

2. **策略生成**（AI）
   - AI 批量生成 N 个候选策略（不同的指标组合、参数空间）
   - 每个策略都有完整的 Go 代码或配置

3. **策略验证**（自动化, new）
   - Syntax and compile check: ensure all generated code passes `go build`
   - Logic guardrails: reject strategies with leverage > 1.0, position limits > 40%, or non-standard asset classes
   - AI code review: use a separate LLM call to flag obvious logic errors before backtesting
   - This step prevents broken or dangerous code from entering the backtest engine

4. **并行回测**（引擎）
   - N 个候选策略同时回测 (via Background backtest worker — see Infrastructure feature table)
   - 取历史 N 年数据，按多维度评分
   - **Overfitting guardrails:** walk-forward validation required for all candidates (train on years 1-N-1, validate on year N); strategies must beat benchmark in both train AND validation windows. Candidates that only pass in-sample are rejected.
   - Minimum backtest window: 3 years of data required for any candidate to be considered

5. **策略排名 + 人类审批**（AI + human)
   - AI ranks by Sharpe, annualized return, max drawdown, win rate, and Calmar ratio
   - Top candidates (top 5, not just top 1) presented to human for selection
   - Human sets final acceptance threshold (e.g., Sharpe > 1.0, max drawdown < 20%)
   - **No strategy enters paper trading without human approval.** Automation applies only to the generation, validation, backtest, and ranking steps — not to deployment.

6. **部署 + 监控**（自动化 + human)
   - Approved strategies enter paper trading pool
   - Continuous monitoring: if strategy Sharpe drops below threshold for 20 consecutive trading days, trigger "策略失效" alert
   - **失效触发条件:** rolling 60-day Sharpe < 0.5 OR rolling max drawdown exceeds original backtest max by 50% → auto-flag for review
   - Human decides: retrain (restart evolution loop), adjust parameters, or retire strategy

7. **自我进化**（循环）
   - Every month: re-run evolution loop with latest data
   - Every quarter: full walk-forward revalidation of all deployed strategies
   - Market regime change detection (via Risk service regime indicator) can trigger early re-run

### 为什么这个架构可行

- **LLM 生成代码** + **自动回测** = 快速验证
- 人的时间从"写代码调参"变成"设定目标和评估结果"
- 量化核心竞争优势从"谁有更好的策略"变成"谁的进化循环更快"

**但这不是魔法 — 以下是已知的局限性和风险:**

1. **Overfitting / Data Snooping**: Generating 100 strategies and backtesting all on the same historical dataset is the classic multiple-testing problem. The system mitigates this via walk-forward validation (train/validate split) and minimum backtest window requirements (3 years). No candidate strategy is accepted purely on in-sample performance.

2. **Strategy generation method**: LLM-generated strategies are prompt-driven (not fine-tuned). The prompt template encodes the `Strategy` interface conventions, factor definitions, and A-share rules. The LLM does not have direct access to the codebase — it receives a structured description of the interface and generates conforming code. Prompt engineering is a real maintenance cost.

3. **No price discovery**: The system optimizes historical returns. It cannot discover alpha that is not already in historical data. If market structure changes (e.g., A-share reform), the evolution loop must be re-run.

4. **Single-market bias risk**: Strategies generated for A-shares may encode China-specific rules (涨跌停, T+1) in the strategy logic itself. A strategy generated for A-shares is not portable to US equities without human review.

### 与 Copilot 的关系

| 层级 | 工具 | 角色 |
|------|------|------|
| Copilot | 人类写策略，AI 辅助 | 人为主 |
| **Evolution** | **AI 生成，人只设定目标** | **AI 为主** |

Copilot 是"AI 帮人类"，Evolution 是"AI 替人类做"。

### 技术前提

Each prerequisite has a concrete definition of "done" and maps to a feature table entry.

| Prerequisite | Concrete Definition of "成熟/Done" | Feature Table Entry |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy Copilot 成熟 | User can submit a Chinese strategy description, receive compilable Go code via LLM, run a backtest in the same session, and iterate on the strategy based on backtest results. Requires: AI integration, code generation prompt templates, and Strategy Copilot UI (P2, Phase 2) | Strategy Copilot (UI layer, P2) |
| 策略数据库 + 版本管理 | `strategies` table exists with JSONB config column, CRUD API implemented, backtest_jobs table tracks strategy version per run, YAML import/export functional | Strategy DB config (Strategy layer, P1) |
| 背景回测服务（独立 worker） | `POST /backtest` returns `job_id` immediately; worker process picks up job and runs async; results persisted to `backtest_jobs` table; client can poll status | Background backtest worker (Infrastructure, P1) |
| 策略监控 + 自动触发重训练 | Monitor deployed strategies' rolling Sharpe and drawdown; alert fired when 失效触发条件 met (see Step 6 above); evolution loop can be re-triggered manually or via alert | Strategy monitoring (Analytics layer, future — add as P1 when Phase 3 begins) |
| Walk-forward validation framework | Backtest engine supports train/validation split by date range; IC analysis and factor decay analysis operational (Factor cache P1 required first) | Factor decay analysis (Analytics, P2); Factor attribution (Analytics, P1) |

## AI Evolution 成功指标（进阶）

除了基础的成功指标，AI 自进化系统有自己的指标：

| 指标 | 目标 | 说明 |
|------|------|------|
| 策略生成速度 | < 5 分钟/100 个候选 | 从目标到候选池的时间 |
| 进化周期 | < 30 分钟/次 | 生成→回测→排名→推荐 全流程 |
| 候选池质量 | Top 10% Sharpe > 基准 50% | 进化出的策略是否真的优于随机 |
| 策略存活率 | 6 个月后仍跑赢基准 > 40% | 策略是否真的有效，不是过拟合 |
| 自动化率 | 无需人工干预进化循环 > 90% | 人类只负责设定目标 |
